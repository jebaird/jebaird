<p>I have had my Cisco 851w for a number of years most of which I used it as an access point. A couple months back I switched ISP's and was able to use it as my router. It had been a very long time since I had configured a Cisco router from scratch. So I ended up spending way too many hours trying to get my lan and the wireless bridged. So I thought i would share my current running config.</p>
<p>Quick notes about this config.</p>
<ul>
    <li>DHCP pool 192.168.0.10 - 255</li>
    <li>Reserved addresses 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.9</li>
    <li>1 WAP wireless network</li>
    <li>Port forwarding to 192.168.0.5 for gaming</li>
</ul>
