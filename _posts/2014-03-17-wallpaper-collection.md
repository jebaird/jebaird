Over the past year I have spent a bit of time every week finding interesting backgrounds for my desktop.
I was increasingly getting annoyed with the amount of time I was spending on this never ending project. 
So I decided to roll my own Windows 7 theme with the backgrounds set to an RSS feed of some of my favorites I have collected over the years. 

You can find the collection [here](/wallpapers/) along with the Windows Theme. Enjoy!
