title: CSS double border using box-shadow

<p>Getting a double border with a different color doesn't leave you with may options.You can use border-style: double or outline: 1px solid blue. But I wanted the double border only on one side, so I decided to play around with the box-shadow rule. Check out the jsfiddle below. I'm using the x and y offset to achieve the effect. Depending on your target element you will have to adjust the x/y offset to match the border-width: width; Its not perfect but it might work in your layout/design</p>
<div style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"><iframe frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" src="http://jsfiddle.net/jebaird/tfvMc/2/embedded/result" style="width: 100%; height: 300px"></iframe></div>
