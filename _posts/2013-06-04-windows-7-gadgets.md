title: Windows 7 Gadgets That I Always Have Installed
tags: [windows]
---

Since Windows 7 was released Microsoft has taken down the live gadget gallery making it harder to find quantity Windows 7 gadgets. I still use Windows 7 as my primary OS and I find the gadgets very handy. Every time I have to do a fresh install I find my scrambling to find them again so, I thought I would post them here.


### Pandora
This runs on flash. Also a little known fact if you run this with peer block and use the add block list, all of the ads will be gone. I have been running this setup for the last couple years and have yet to hear an ad!

### Presto's Clock
Probably one of the best gadgets out there for Windows 7. You can change the date and time format that's displayed and make many visual tweaks.

### SNMP Network Monitor
I use version 1.1 that still requires the "SNMP WMI Provider" to be installed. I have tried using the later versions but I was unable to get them to work.

### Chameleon Glass Pack
I use the weather gadget out of this pack. I like it better than the default weather gadget because its not as distracting.
