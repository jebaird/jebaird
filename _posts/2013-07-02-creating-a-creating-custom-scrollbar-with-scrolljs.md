title: Creating a custom scrollbar with scrolljs
tags: [javascript,projects]

Over the past couple of years I have built a couple of custom scrollbar plugins ShortScroll and aceScroll. On both projects have allow me to explore the dom scroll api. I'll admit taking that its a little over wleaming when you start out. 

When I added the scroll option to dragtable I found my self lookking / wanting to use some of the scroll widgets api to check if an element was scrollable. Which gave me the idea to create a libary that would normalize the scroll api for use in other projects.
