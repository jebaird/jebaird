title: Javascript templating engines - quick overview
layout: post
tags: [javascript, iowajs]
---
<p>I recently gave a talk on javascript templating engines and was able to for the first time record it with google over air hangouts. This was one of the first presentations that I have given over javascript. I find templating a very diverse topic. It seems that there is't a wrong way to do it only that that you are doing it. Hopefully you will find this useful. Please feel free to leave comments on youtube or on the slides. Any content corrections are quite welcome.</p>
