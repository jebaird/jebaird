<p>I wanted to decrease the sizes of my pages on my blog with out changing my design. I had been using css sprites and gziped css + with base64 encoded images but due to my design my page size was 1500k on an empty cache.&nbsp; My blog was like this for over a year. But in the past few months my pages started to seem like they were loading slower and slower. So I decided to write a small script that randomly places images on an html5 canvas.&nbsp; It can also rotate, add color overlay and scale the images. You might find it useful to create a randomly generate header or footer to your site. I got my page size down to around 300k using this script.</p>
<p>Here is the code please feel free to fork it, or use bits and peices of it. If your looking for a demo of the code, just check the header and or the footer my blog.&nbsp; If you have quesitons please feel free to ask.</p>
