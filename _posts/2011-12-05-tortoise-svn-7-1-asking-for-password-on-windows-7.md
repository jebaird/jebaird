<p>Last week I updated to tortoise svn 7.1 on my desktop. Everything seemed to be working right, but it kept asking for my password every time I connected to a ssh+svn repos even with a connection to the server via pageant (version .60). So I was forced to type in my password every time I connected to the server.</p>
<p>Turns out that I needed to update to pageant version .62 and problem solved.</p>
