<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/aptana-studio-3-integrated-development-environment-beginners-guide/book?source=jebaird.com" target="_blank">Aptana Studio Beginner's Guide by Thomas Deuling</a> covers everything in Aptana Studio from installation to setting up the built in collaborative features. Having used Aptana Studio for the past few years I still found this book helpful. It would have been great to have on my shelf when I started using Aptana. As you many have found out there isn't a lot the web pertaining to getting Aptana setup.</p>
<p>I think Chapter 2, &quot;Basics and How to use Perspectives and Views&quot; is the one that I gleaned the most from. I had never thought about why you would want to use / setup perspectives. It turns out that setting up a view / perspective can greatly effect your project workflow and help divide up similar tasks / projects.</p>
<p>Another thing I liked about this book was the way the chapters were organized. I found it very useful when looking how to do / setup a feature. The basic flow looks like this.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Changing the color theme(Steps to getting this task done)</li>
    <li>Sort paragraph describing what this task will do and why you would want to do it</li>
    <li>Steps with screen shots and or commands to get the task done</li>
    <li>Exerts for explaining new terms</li>
    <li>Wrap up</li>
</ol>
<p>If you get a chance, I would recommend that you pick up this book. I think you will find a useful reference in the future. You can view more of the book on the publishers site <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/aptana-studio-3-integrated-development-environment-beginners-guide/book?source=jebaird.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>* As a matter of full disclosure, I did receive a free ebook of this book to review.</p>
