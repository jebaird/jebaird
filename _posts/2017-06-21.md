I've been with my current employer, ONTRAPORT for the past seven and a half years. Over that time I've seen and experienced the engineering department grow from three( including me) to a team well over 30 members. This is something I'm very grateful to have been a part of. 

During that time I developed and wrote different interview tests, reviewed resumes and conducted interviews. 

* never though i would recommend to hire someone that would end up being my manager
* I didn't see the full benefit of the 2 track system until now. tech lead vs tech manager
* its freed me up to focus primarily on tech things
