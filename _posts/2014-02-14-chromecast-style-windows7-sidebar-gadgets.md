I've had a chromecast for a couple of months now. One of the things that I really like about it is how the time was displayed. So I decided to create a set of windows gadgets that look like they would fit on the default chromecast display.

You can find the code [https://github.com/jebaird/win7-chromecast-gadgets](https://github.com/jebaird/win7-chromecast-gadgets)


## Installation

You can download the *.gadget files [here](/media/2014-02-14-chromecast-style-windows7-sidebar-gadgets/chromecast-style-windows7-gadgets.zip).


If you have node installed you can clone / download the repo and run `npm install` then `grunt copy` then and the gadget to your desktop like another other gadget. 

This is the best way to insure you have the latest version(s).

## Text

Allows you to display any text you would like. I've found this quite useful for displaying custom shortcut keys I've added and reminders. 


## Date

This gadget displays the current date in a non nonsense fashion.

## Weather

## Pidglet

It depends on this pidgin plugin being installed and working [https://code.google.com/p/pidglet/](https://code.google.com/p/pidglet/) Download and install it before trying to get this gadget to work.


## What about a clock?
