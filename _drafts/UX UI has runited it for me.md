UX / UI as a buzz word has ruined it for me

Garbage dispoals, Ground up UX

In the past few years the abberations UI/UX have been thrown around more often than Patton Manning threw in the 2013 season. There has been lots of debate of what this all means in regaruds to design especially when it comes web sites / apps. Although it has changed the way I look at sites and apps, the bigger change for me has come for how I look at every day things. 

A few weeks ago my we were hosting my family for Christmas. My wife gave me the task of cleaning out the kitchen. After doing the dishes, I ran the garage disposal which lead to a huge puddle of water on my kitchen floor. I looked under the sink and water was gushing out of the disposal. After a whole slue of 4 letter words like, duck, cats, dogs etc(you didn't see that coming). I was of to the hardware store for a replacement. 

After trouncing around at the hardware store trying to figure out what I needed to replace the grider, I was back at home. I opened the box and all of the peices were put together in the correct order and 
directions looked good enough so I figured I wouldnt have any problems. I removed the old sink-mounting flange and installed the new one. I aligned and hooked up the drainage pipes, the dish washer drain and the electric plug. Now all I had to do is twist the displosoal over, so it would be in lock mode(on the model I got, the sink flange has to notches where the disposal as tabs that stick out from the side. You move them over half way when installing and all of the way when you are done). After 30 minutes of trying to move the disposal all the way over to the right in the locking position, I gave up. F**k it, why doesn't this thing what to connect to its self? It kind of works but doesn't. I had visions of my wife in 2 years turning on the disposal and it just falling off leaving our kitchen a nasty mess of half chopped up food and water. So I just told my self, if I haven't been able to move this for 20 mins then its not going to move.

add a note about it not working, think of all of the problems that they had to solve with just this one issue.

So what does this have to do with sites / apps? In my opinion a half designed product/site/app provides a poorer experience than one that wasn't designed at all. To contrast my experience with the disposal. The old one that was broken used 4 screws in place of tabbed colalor of the new one. I can only imagen how easy it was to install. Because it was pretty easy to remove. 

Just because it's not used that often doesnt mean you can slack on the design. I would guess that disposals are not removed weekly. So the derringers might say Its not that big of a deal if the installer has an issue. Take this case in to consdieration I don't know how many times I have wanted to scream after taking my car to the shop to have something like the spark plugs changed and hearing that 5 of the 6 are easy to get to but the 6th one they have to unhook the engine mounts to get to making the 1 hour job take 5. WTF mate? Who was incharge that day?

So with all of the talk about how important UX/UI is it has raised my expectations for all of the products/designs around me. I'm constantly looking at how things are designed and thinking about how it coudl be better and what challanages its diesngers faced. I've tried the 

Its definitely changed the way I look at the products, software and documentation I write and create.
