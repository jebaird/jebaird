title: innovation, what is is
---

This past June I was awarded the "Innovate" award at Ontraport. Every year awards are handed to the employee(s) that exemplify particular a company value. Along with a shinny glass award you get to give a talk to every new hire class that calendar year about why you got the award and what it means to you. 

Since then have have been asking the question, What is innovation? The [dictionary](https://www.google.com/search?q=Innovate) has it defined as: 

> 1. make changes in something established, esp. by introducing new methods, ideas, or products.

> 2. introduce (something new, esp. a product).

I would say that's pretty clear definition. Buts that not how I've heard the word widely used over in mass media. Take this comment for instance. 

> ["Our League has always strived to stay on the cutting edge of innovation,..."](http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/011414aab.html). 

What? You try to stay ahead of change? So you try to change before change happens? That doesn't make any sense! More often than not you hear tibits like

> "Steve Jobs was the greatest innovator of our generation"

He produced a product line that made Apple one of the richest companies in the world. That's pretty impressive and not to be minimized. But, I think we end up putting achievements like that on a  pedestal. It makes the "living" definition of the word different than the one in the dictionary. Which makes the word innovate only for the rich and famous. Something that only be done if you have cured cancer. That can be quite demotivating when taking on a new project. How could anything I do be as good / valued as that? I believe that we are able / and capable of doing so.

Comments like this one have inspired me to further reevaluate how I look/view the word Innovate. 


## Building Momentum

I think that lack of movement in any direction is the biggest road block to change. I say in any direction because, what might seem a step backwards could be in fact forwards. Just recently [typewriters got another go around in Russia](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/11/kremlin-typewriters_n_3579184.html). At some point someone remembered how much easier it is to secure a limited number of documents over digital ones.

Just like trying to start a car in sub zero temperatures, it can be very difficult to understand the scope and or steps needed of the task at hand. Sometimes I will reach an impasse where no amount of thinking about the project will bring me closer to the end. This is the point, I have found that I can build momentum through switching the context of change. For exsmaple, I'll try changing small things around me or doing every day things differently like; switching my desktop background, the direction I mow my lawn or which side of my face I start on when I shave. It sounds silly, but it seems it seems to have a spill over effect in other parts of my life.

Metal flexibility is what I think is needed. 


The point I'm, trying to drive home is that change begets change regardless of its origin. I think its about breaking out of your comfort zone to be able to look at things differently despite there context. 

Out of these small changes else where I have found that "innovations" will arise.



the nartive is always lost when the story is told. to me thats the most important part. Thats the part that inspires me, it makes me understand the value. I want to know how you got to the point where you made X deciention. its exciting to see and understand what when on





 the small steps to change always seem to be lost when the story is told. I like to think of this as the narrative of the project/story/change. I have noticed when I have lost the narrative of a project it makes me minimize my accomplishments. Which can leave me feeling unhappy about the progress / changes I have made. And no one wants to feel that. Its a hard balance to strike, carrying the native and having a short memory. Since having a short memory can help you overcome any past obstacles/failures.
